/*
    1. 'httpGet' is provided for you.
    2. You have to implement 'httpGetParallel' and 'httpGetSerial'
       using 'httpGet'. See signatures below.
    3. 'testAsync' will try running your 'httpGetParallel' and
       'httpGetSerial' with some test URLs. The expected output
       is shown at the very bottom of this file.

    You can run this on your computer with Node.js or use an online JavaScript
    environment that allows HTTP requests, e.g. https://runjs.co/

    Expected results after implementing httpGetParallel and httpGetSerial:
